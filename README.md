# sol2nonlinearOptim
A complete guide to the book [Introduction to Nonlinear Optimization: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications with Python and MATLAB](https://archive.siam.org/books/mo19/).

This is a repository which aims to provide solutions to all the exercises in this amazing book. Besides that, I may expand some simplified derivations and the points which are not straightforward in the textbook when needed. Please feel free to contact me (youming0.zhao@gmail) about any mistakes you spot or suspect, be it typos or more serious things. I try to number every formula for your convinence to point out possible issues. I appreciate any input, always.

[The seond edition](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611977622) of this book is published on June 29, 2023. The new version provides solutions for some of the exercises. Currently, I have not got the new version. Thus, the solutions in this repository are all for the first version. Once I get the second edition, I will update this guide accordingly.

I regularly update the solutions in order. If you really want to get the solution to an excersice which is not in my repo yet, you can also email me. I will work on it first. 

At last, if you would like to know more about me, please check out my [homepage](https://mathfirst.github.io/).
